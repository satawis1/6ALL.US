        <h2>IPHONE 15 PRO</h2>
<p>Apple's  iPhone 11 Pro models is the first and probably the last of its kind. The first  Pro model of the iPhone joins the ranks of iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro.  An &quot;iPhone for professionals&quot; that offer just a little bit extra, but  matter a lot to pro mobile users. An iPhone for which the smartphone is a tool  and an instrument. The best of the iPhone that Apple has to offer!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="IPHONE 15 PRO"/></p>

<h3>The best  Smartphone screen currently available</h3>
<p>According  to the analysis of <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/" title="DisplayMate" target="_blank">DisplayMate</a> experts, the Super <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Display_XDR" title="Pro Display XDR" target="_blank">Retina XDR screen</a> of the iPhone  11 Pro (Max is by far the best Smartphone screen. As expected, <em><strong>Apple's displays</strong></em> are considered the best in the  industry for many years.</p>
<p>The Super  Retina XDR screen has achieved the highest DisplayMate A+ rating to date. It  reaches a minimum luminosity typical of 800 nits and a maximum brightness of  1200 nits. This makes the screen about 50 percent brighter than most other  displays in current flagship stores. This is clearly visible when you use the  iPhone 11 Pro outdoors, in direct sunlight and in bright environments in  general. In addition, this OLED panel offers an impressive contrast ratio of  2,000,000: 1, coupled with the absolute color fidelity of Apple, support for  HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats.</p>
<p>The 3D  Touch replaced by &quot;Haptic Touch&quot;, a combination of Taptic Engine and  software. This combination is meant to mimic the 3D Touch user experience.  Alas, without the necessary equipment for 3D Touch, the experience is  different. The good thing is that the absence of 3D Touch has also created more  space for a bigger battery.</p>
<p>The screen  sizes, and pixel density of 458 dpi are unchanged from previous models. As a  result, the 5.8-inch OLED display offers a resolution of 1125 x 2436 pixels and  the iPhone 11 Pro a 6.5-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1242 x 2688  pixels. Each with &ldquo;True Tone&rdquo; technology, which automatically adjusts the level  of white to ambient light and colors.</p>

<h3>With iOS  13 on board</h3>
<p>Apple's  official document with all the new features of iOS 13 includes 28 pages. But  this document is not very detailed. So, we will overview only the most  important features.</p>
<p>iOS 13  comes with a system-wide Dark Mode that can be turned on and off automatically  based on the time of day or manually. It also includes many third-party  applications that easily connect to the system in dark mode.</p>
<p>The camera  applications from iOS 13 have been redesigned to reflect the new features of  the camera. The new photo application automatically retains all photo and video  material.</p>
<p>With the  new privacy feature &quot;Connect with Apple&quot;,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc" target="_blank"> Apple</a> is competing with Google  and Facebook. That allow their users to connect to other services with one  click. However, Apple relies entirely on privacy, hide the user's email  address, and protect users from advertising and social tracking.</p>
<p>Siri has  also been improved&nbsp;with iOS 13. The new voice is better and sounds a  little more natural. It also now offers better proactive suggestions for  content and applications. The new voice command under iOS 13 is not really a function  of Siri. This help is hidden by this feature, which allows you to control all  iOS, as well as all third-party applications, only by voice.</p>
<h3>13  Bionic chip: the fastest Smartphone CPU</h3>
<p>The iPhone  11, iPhone 11 Pro and IPHONE 15 PRO are all equipped with Apple's latest  A13 Bionic chip. Its six-core CPU consists of two high-performance cores with running at  2.65&nbsp;GHz and &nbsp;four  energy-efficient cores.  The first under the name &quot;Lightning&quot; and the second under the name  &quot;Thunder&rdquo;. So, if someone asks you what technology is in the new iPhone,  you can seriously say &quot;thunder and lightning&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="IPHONE 15 PRO"/></p>
<h3>iPhone  11 Pro Max design</h3>
<p>At first sight, the IPHONE 15 PRO might look  like a boring update. But in addition to the third camera in the back, and the <strong>latest</strong>&nbsp;and greatest&nbsp;<strong>flagship</strong>, Apple added many other innovations  that we will find surely in future generations, and will also become standard  equipment in all industries.</p>
<p>The Notch  is still there and is very visible. The same thing goes for the slightly wider  edges around the screen. Basically, the iPhone 11 Pro and IPHONE 15 PRO  have increased in all directions by a few millimeters compared to their  predecessors.</p>
<p>The back of  the new Pro models is characterized by an matt glass consisting of the &quot;toughest  glass in a Smartphone&quot; according to Apple, which was developed in  partnership with Corning, the company behind Gorilla Glass. Pleasant to the touch and high  quality, the terminal seems quite resistant to scratches and fingerprints.</p>
<p>The new  three-camera system is embedded in the glass. The cameras protrudes slightly&nbsp;instead of  being flush with the back of the device. Personally, the design of the  triple camera is a bit strange, but judging from comments left by  customers, everyone does not think the same way.</p>
<p>The design  not only concerns the appearance of a device but also its usefulness. One of the biggest design flaws on the iPhone  11 Pro and Max is the presence of the USB 2.0 Lightning port. All other Pro  devices in the Apple catalog, including iPad Pro, incorporate a Type-C USB port  that is at least compatible with USB 3.0 technology.</p>
<p>This means  that if you want to transfer all the photos and videos taken with the cameras  of the iPhone 11 Pro to an uncompressed form and without loss of data on your  PC, you will have to rely on Airdrop or do everything with a cable connection  USB 2.0. Airdrop is a solid system but not always available as an option.</p>
<p>Let's be  honest, most of those who choose an IPHONE 15 PRO by investing so much  money can be considered &quot;professionals&quot; and want to take photos and videos.  This lack is felt and if it could be forgiven on the iPhone 11 normal, it is  not the same for the Pro model.</p>
